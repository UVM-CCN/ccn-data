Hawk News Service grew out of the Center for Cooperative Media, which launched at Montclair State in 2012, the same year that the university created its School of Communication and Media. While it’s based at the university, the center operates mostly on private grant funding to bolster local news organizations in New Jersey. It provides media outlets of all sizes with training and coaching, professional support, and connections to legal, financial and other services.

Stefanie Murray, director of the Center for Cooperative Media, came up with idea for Hawk News Service to not only support those local publications with eager reporters but give the students a chance to build their portfolios with published work.",Interviewed,,"Public, Minority-Serving Institution, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands",,,,,,,,,,,,#REF!,New Jersey,-74.19485446,40.79538258,,,,,,,,,,,,

",News Academic Partnership: 2024 or Earlier,,Department of Journalism and Media Studies,Deborah Howlett,Lecturer,https://njstatenews.com/,Newark,NJ,debhowlett@gmail.com,2023,2023 Statehouse Faculty Champion,"Summary: Launched in the summer of 2023, the New Jersey Statehouse News Service is a collaborative nonprofit involving Rowan University, The College of New Jersey, and Rutgers University, with potential future involvement from other universities. The program in the next five years aims to increase intern numbers from the current five to 10-12 per semester, with additional recent graduate fellows working 10 months at a time and a professional staff of three: a managing editor, a director, and a multimedia editor. Currently, they have two part-time professional editors and five interns. There’s no age or major requirement, but typically the students are juniors and seniors (usually, they prefer seniors) with a journalism background. The College of New Jersey is about five miles from the capital and is the closest of the three schools participating. The other two schools are about 40 miles – a one-hour drive – away. No faculty members besides Howlett are working on this program.
Distribution: The service currently partners with 22 organizations comprising more than 100 news outlets. Howlett is exploring new sustainable funding sources, such as through Report for America, and wider media partnerships to cover more of the 400-plus media outlets in New Jersey. The program offers interns class credit and mileage reimbursements, and are otherwise unpaid; in the future, Howlett also wants to give students stipends of around $2,500. The Statehouse News Service is entirely a wire service and, as of now, doesn’t publish anything itself. They are starting with $100,000 in funding from the New Jersey Civic Information Consortium; this money has been used to hire additional part-time staff.
Looking forward: For the first time in the summer of 2025, Princeton University will participate by paying for and coordinating students to work for the news service at the statehouse during the summer months while the legislature is still in session; this will help fill gaps when students working during the school year finish their internship with the end of the spring semester. 
Notable: The number of hours students work for the program varies by school. They’re all asked to write one to two weekly stories: a straight news story and a more ambitious enterprise story. The program is not strict about meeting a quota.",Complete,,"Public, Minority-Serving Institution, Has any Journalism program, Population size 10-20 thousands",,,7,"""We are trying to track these specificially but so far we have 18 confirmed.""",7,"We had asked for page views.

Director, Journalism Minor",,Newark,DE,nancyk@udel.edu,2026,2023 Statehouse Faculty Champion,"Summary: The University of Delaware in the spring of 2026 will launch a six-credit fellowship from January to June. Students will get one credit in January, three credits during the school semester, and two more credits for continuing into June. The fellowship will be offered for four to two students and is open to students majoring or minoring in public policy, political science, political communications, journalism, or other communications. The fellowship will fulfill a capstone degree requirement for any arts and sciences student participating at the 400 level. It also fulfills electives for the journalism minor. Nancy Karibjanian, Director of the Journalism Program at the University of Delaware who will be running the program, hopes to limit the fellowship to juniors to avoid making a senior commit to the June portion of the program. UD’s campus in Newark is about 50 minutes away by car from the state capitol in Dover. Every student will also be asked to follow one bill, with Karibjanian’s approval for newsworthiness. 
Distribution: The program will mix broadcast and digital print reporting. The outlet’s editor will edit the students’ work, and Karibjanian plans to use a Listserv to distribute stories to partnering organizations. Students can take assignments from local radio or news outlets at any point during the semester. Karibjanian will review any assignments from the outlets to approve the story concept for its legitimacy and relevance for a student journalist.
Looking forward: It’s unclear if transportation can be arranged or if students will have to drive themselves. Karibjanian said students may have to start by listening to the live stream of floor debates as a backup, in case they can’t transport themselves to the statehouse in person. 
Notable: Karibjanian wants the students to cover stories other outlets are not covering; she is still working out partnerships with local outlets beyond Delaware Public Media and is exploring partnerships with other local radio and broadcast stations.

All journalism (M.J. not M.A.) graduate students are required to work in one of the news bureaus, whereas undergraduates have to apply for it as a capstone. (Graduate students apply for their preferred bureau, but do not always receive their top choice). Started in 1990, the bureau and the companion courses operate in the spring and fall. Graduate students get six credits for working four days per week. Undergraduate students get six credits for working two days a week or nine credits for working for days a week. The class size varies per semester, sometimes reaching as many as ten graduate and undergraduate students. The program is managed by long-time journalist and editor Martin Kaiser and Annapolis Bureau chief Christi Parsons. The statehouse is a 40 to 45-minute drive from campus. 
Distribution: The bureau has around 30 news organization clients and charges $100 or $200 per semester, depending on their size -- and also provides content to AP. The revenue goes toward student stipends for travel. The bureau produces from 25 to 75 stories per semester, depending on the number of students in the Annapolis Bureau. 
Looking forward: “I would like to grow the participation in my bureau. I have mostly have seniors and graduate students, but I would like to have younger students come and be part of the Bureau, to expand the staff. … Another thing is, I would like to recruit more students from the community college level.”
Notable: Funding comes from the University budget and pays for the faculty bureau chiefs and rent for the Annapolis office, which is a block away from the statehouse.

The program is funded through the university. The students are taught by professor Alix Bryan-Campos, who took over in 2019 and launched the fall course. Bryan-Campos also serves as one of the editors for the student work. The articles produced by the program are distributed to more than 100 news outlets, with almost every article being reposted by an outside news outlet. The students are encouraged to reach out to local papers and communicate with news editors to get story ideas. The program has launched an additional course called the CNS Copy Desk to teach students fact-checking, editing and AP Style by editing real stories in order to help support the editing work before it is ultimately handed over to Bryan-Campos, who meets one-on-one with the student. The program also has a newsroom director position to help ensure relevancy and accuracy of the student-reported articles, develop partnerships with new media clients, maintain the CNS listserv and website, organize a portfolio review, lead special collaborative projects, edit and be a liaison between journalism courses, Bryan-Campos said.","Emailed, Waiting on Response",,"Public, Minority-Serving Institution, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands",,,,,,,,yes!,,,804-921-0114,Virignia Commonwealth University,Virginia,-77.4518,37.55149,,,234030.0,,https://www.uvm.edu/ccn/news/covering-state-house-virginia,,https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Center-for-Community-News/pdfs/fact%20sheets/Virginia_Commonwealth_University_.pdf,,,,,

Students mainly take assignments from the bureau they are interning with, but the bureau is required to share their coverage with any competing news outlet in the state that also wishes to use it. OU’s campus in Athens is about an hour’s drive away from the state capitol in Columbus. Students typically live in the capitol city during their internship, often staying with their family. Students are paid about $6,900 as a stipend for the semester and required to work as an intern covering the statehouse for 200 hours that semester. All journalism students at OU are required to take some sort of semester-long internship, though not all opt to cover their legislature. The student salaries are funded by the Scripps Howard Fund and fellows' host news organizations. Students can opt to get 1 to 3 credits during the semester, but unlike a full internship, that requires them to pay tuition. Professionals at the newsroom housing the interns assign and edit their stories while faculty member Dr. Thomas Suddes provides simultaneous mentoring. Suddes, who has 30 years of statehouse reporting experience, also has professional connections with the local journalism market that helps students secure internships.

First launched in 2006 by lecturer Mark Johnson, the workshop is the signature event of the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication’s documentary photojournalism course each spring. (Student enrolled in the fall semester get a similar experience during a workshop at the state fair.) Over the last 20 years, the workshop has been held in 17 different counties. Before the workshop begins, students develop and pitch story ideas, so when they arrive in the county for that weekend, they’re ready to jump into their reporting. Johnson invites experienced photojournalists to come work through the weekend as coaches, reviewing the material students gather with them each day. Before each workshop, Johnson establishes partnerships with local news outlets to distribute the stories. After each workshop, local news partners often publish initial photos spreads. Then, the outlets have the option to pick up students’ projects, including photo essays and multimedia pieces. The student work is also published on the college’s website.
 
The class includes a mixture of students in their second and third photojournalism semesters. This mixture creates a dynamic where the more experienced students serve as mentors for students who are not as far along. “Part of the program's core belief is that knowledge is not yours, and so you have a responsibility to help others within the class,” says Johnson. “The goal is for everybody to get better at this.”","Emailed, Waiting on Response",,"Public, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands",Amanda Bright,amanda.bright@uga.edu,,,,,"Amanda says ""Mark Johnson is the contact for the photojournalism partnerships.""","I think Amanda is the person to start with -- she runs two of these, also Mark Johnson photography, and a statehosue one??

Each school will have initially two to four students who will get paid $12 an hour for up to 10 hours of work a week during the fall and spring semesters. Additionally, each school will host one full-time summer internship where the student will be paid $12 an hour to write stories for their local community outlets. Reporting can include print, digital, broadcast and social media. To encourage more stories out of classrooms, students reporting for a class can earn a $100 stipend for any publishable story at any of these schools. Individual schools can decide whether students can also earn credit by participating this program.
Looking forward: Ideally, this collaboration will grow to include more schools in Louisiana and serve as an emulatable model for other states.

Initially serving as a forum to help scientists and researchers better tell the stories of their research, the program began hiring journalism students to write about food systems innovations. The Food Fix includes a mixture of a podcast and written articles. The podcast launched when a plant science graduate student pitched the idea. Through the podcast, researchers and student journalists are interviewed about various food systems projects happening around the world and in Michigan. The podcast is hosted by a paid student host, often a graduate student. The Food Fix website also publishes articles by students enrolled in MSU’s various environmental journalism classes, when their subjects intersect with food systems issues. Those student articles may also be distributed through other university news publications if they intersect with those specific topics, such as the Great Lakes Echo, if relevant to the Great Lakes region, or the Capital News Service, if relevant to Michigan Public Policy.

The multimedia class, which fulfills a degree requirement, includes five students and will collaborate with The Nashville Banner and the newly launched national Statehouse Network headed by Mark Horvit at the University of Missouri. Guest lecturers from the Associated Press, The New York Times, and The Tennessee Journal will also join the class. The editor of The Nashville Banner, a Belmont alum, will mentor students. The class will be offered every spring semester while the legislature is in session. The students – all juniors and seniors majoring in journalism – will have opportunities to meet at the statehouse during class time and are encouraged to go up to Capitol Hill outside of class hours. The campus is about 10 minutes from the statehouse, and the students will have to navigate downtown parking. They will also attend the Tennessee Press Association Winter Conference, which features lessons in leadership around rural journalism and community issues, as well as investigative reporting. After an initial introduction to the statehouse, each student has been asked to come up with 10 pitches to inform future projects throughout the semester. They will focus on evergreen stories over daily news; students will produce a feature story and several other pieces. Duck has 20 years of local and national journalism experience, including working for ABC News as a White House reporter and producer during the George W. Bush administration, as well as the 2007 presidential campaigns of President Barrack Obama and U.S. Sen. John McCain. Additionally, she was a producer with Anderson Cooper covering politics from 2013 to 2018. Funding includes $500 for parking at the statehouse, Tennessee Press Association winter conference fees, and potentially phone-pairing microphones for broadcast reporting.

Medill Senior Lecturer Storer H. (Bob) Rowley, former national editor and foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune, directs the student bureau, edits their stories and works with editors at Capitol News Illinois to get the stories published. Students commit to three months of statehouse reporting during the fellowship for one academic quarter after they are chosen; they get stipends, lodging and transportation aid funded by a grant from the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.
Distribution: The students are directly contributing to Medill’s Local News Initiative by substantively helping cover local news and fill gaps in state news coverage. The first 10 stories written for CNI by the graduate student fall Statehouse Fellows were picked up in dozens of newspapers, broadcast and digital outlets around the state, leading to tens of thousands of pageviews in CNI partner outlets.
Looking forward: In addition, the fellows are also helping advise researchers at Medill’s Knight Lab who are working on using artificial intelligence and other tech automation to help make sense of legislative votes, bills and laws to assist journalists covering the Illinois General Assembly.
Notable: Faculty choose the students based on applications, and students take a related class on politics or advanced reporting while serving as fellows in this program. When they travel to the statehouse to cover the Illinois General Assembly and other state government stories, they work two to three full days for the program each week on top of their class and writing stories when they are back in Chicago or on campus, averaging 20 to 25 hours a week of statehouse reporting work. Rowley wants students to aid the full-time professional reporters at the Capitol by finding stories that CNI professionals on staff may not have the time or bandwidth to cover on their own.

Through the course, taught by Christopher Drew, students investigate Civil Rights-era cold cases. The course was developed based on an open records request made by Drew’s predecessor at LSU. In 2018, he was notified by the FBI and National Archives that three subject files related to Civil Rights-era investigations, totaling more than 2,000 pages, were ready. The files have provided a starting point for investigations into cold cases. Each semester, Drew selects specific cases or themes, which student journalists probe through public records, interviews and other techniques. The class meets once a week for an hour and a half, giving students time to work on aspects of the investigation outside of class hours. Enrollment is typically between 10-13 students. Students’ reporting on the shooting deaths of two Southern University students in 1972 by a sheriff’s deputy won a national investigative reporting award from Investigative Reporters & Editors in 2022.
 
Students’ work is made available for any news publication to pick up free of charge. Drew notifies outlets about the stories through an email list maintained for distributing LSU’s Statehouse Bureau stories. Students have also produced digital products, like videos and a podcast, which was distributed through local public radio stations.
 
Drew says the focus on historic cases is a strength of the course. Investigations into current issues or officials can be higher pressure and carry more legal risks. Meanwhile, the spotlight that students have shed on decades-old cases has had real impacts. “On one hand, it's great training and education for the students,” Drew says. “On the other hand, it's great closure in the community.”",Complete,,"Public, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands",,,,,,,,"Note Chris has 8 schools in the new consortium, they are just starting and we shoudl capture that, so that would be six new schools -- ",,,Not Found,Louisiana State University,Louisiana,-91.17735,30.41579,,,159391.0,,Solving racially motivated crimes -- LSU's Cold Case program (2023),,LSU Cold Case Project,,,,,

Two of the five interns will work with the prominent local news outlet owner Forum Communications, providing news content for its 15 newsrooms in Minnesota. The other three interns will work directly out of the Capitol with Mike Mulcahy, a longtime political editor at Minnesota Public Radio with years of experience in the Minnesota Legislature, who is receiving a stipend to help tailor their work for publication in other news organizations. The program aims to fill news coverage gaps for smaller outlets. Minnesota’s legislative project is one of several Report for Minnesota initiatives. Golden was previously a reporter at the Dallas Morning News and was a regular reporting contributor to the New York Times. She’s been teaching at the University of Minnesota for over 20 years.
Distribution: So far, six news organizations with distribution in 17 communities in the state have agreed to partner. Mulcahy will communicate with editors on what kind of coverage they are looking for, and that will guide what his interns cover. Mulcahy’s students will produce stories weekly, and each student will aim to produce at least one story per week. 
Looking forward: Select students also spend summer internships in rural news organizations, and Golden is considering a project to partner with news organizations based on reporting projects that grow from the legislative work this spring. 
Notable: Students won’t have a travel stipend, but UMN students have free use of public transportation from campus to the statehouse.

They’ll also cover open records and public meetings and have guest speakers and lectures. The program seeks to balance classroom learning with real-world experience, with potential for future expansion and capstone opportunities, McCoy said. She plans to work with other professors in advanced reporting classes in case they touch on legislative work and want student reporting published. Drake University is about three and a half miles from the Iowa State Capitol, and students can take the bus there for free. They won’t be required to go to the statehouse in person, since legislative debates in Iowa are live-streamed, but opportunities will be offered to report from there. McCoy wrote for The Associated Press for 13 years before becoming a public information officer for Iowa’s human services agency followed by serving as legislative liaison for the state’s public health department during the pandemic. She will be editing student stories and working to place them.",Complete,"Statehouse, ""Democracy, Governance & Elections"", Part of a Class, Students Get Course Credit, Open to Non-Journalism Majors/Minors","Private, Has any Journalism program, Population size less 5 thousands",,,,,,,,"May be pretty limited, some statehouse, sarah?",New,,4022015097,Drake University,Iowa,-93.6546,41.6031,,,153269.0,,https://www.uvm.edu/ccn/news/drake-university-develops-course-fill-gap-created-decline-local-reporting,,,,,,,

University of Kansas,Statehouse Reporting Class,"This three-credit capstone class every spring semester hosts between 10 and 18 journalism students, mostly seniors, who typically go to the statehouse once a week during the session from January through May to provide content to news outlets across the state.",News Academic Partnership: 2024 or Earlier,,William Allen White School of Journalism and Mass Communications,Patricia Gaston,"Lacy C. Haynes Professor of Journalism,
Professor of the Practice",,Lawrence,KS,Patricia.Gaston@ku.edu,2012,No,"Summary: The three-credit capstone class started in 2012 and hosts between 10 and 18 journalism students, mostly seniors, every spring semester. Students typically go to the statehouse once a week during the session, which runs from January through May. They end their coverage when the semester ends, not when the session ends. Washington Post editor Patricia Weems Gaston and focuses largely on day-to-day coverage with stories available to about 190 news outlets in Kansas. Students commute 30 minutes by car to Topeka and can either be a reporter or an editor depending on their career ambitions. 
Distribution: Each student has to do 18 features or dailies, and two enterprise pieces. Gaston, who is the bureau chief, edits and posts all stories on a private site that requires a sign-in and allows Kansas Press Association members to log in and download stories. In return, the KPA provides $5,000 per year for student’s gas/tolls as well as student awards. 
Looking forward: The program has also been collaborating on some coverage with the University of Missouri, its neighbor to the east, since 2024. For example, students from both schools worked together on a story about maternity deserts, which ran both on the Kansas program’s statehouse website and in the Columbia Missourian. 
Notable: Gaston typically doesn’t tell students what to cover because she wants them to learn about pitching and developing stories. Students receive a bonus depending on the quality of their work, ranging from $300 to $500. During the pandemic, like many programs, students continued to cover the legislature but through Zoom.

We won't know until mid-/late summer if we will have any lines to hire for 2026. If we do, I will certainly think how we can connect with TSU on this. I do love the idea of being a hub for Houston media, partnering with TSU and HPM (and Rice). And, I do appreciate the offer to match funds — that would be very helpful!

As I approach conversations with my dean about hiring in the next month, I will let him know about this opportunity. 

In the meantime, I believe our faculty are interested in moving our capstone course to a year-long experience. As we more fully discuss, I will keep you posted about what that could look like in terms of making a news bureau come to life, even if we can't hire.

University of Nebraska-Lincoln,Nebraska News Service,The statehouse coverage class reports on the state legislature. ,News Academic Partnership: 2024 or Earlier,,College of Journalism and Mass Communications,Jill Martin,Associate Professor,https://nebraskanewsservice.net/,Lincoln,NE,jmartin42@unl.edu,2011,No,"Summary: The University of Nebraska’s Nebraska News Service has operated a statehouse bureau since 2011 and has since been merged with a newer program called the Experience Lab for different communications majors, and is also folded into a capstone course. Both the capstone and Experience Lab expand beyond statehouse coverage. The statehouse coverage class meets for 1 hour and 45 minutes every Monday and Wednesday, with each student only going to the statehouse one of those days. The campus is only a few blocks away from the statehouse. The class is one credit per semester, and students must take it three times for their degree. 
Distribution: Professionals, many of whom are either retired or working in the industry hoping to hire students post-grad, offer mentoring and guidance such as line editing. Students cover the statehouse and the content is provided to about 90 to 100 outlets, some radio and TV but mostly newspapers. 
Looking forward: “I'm still trying to figure out how we expand it, because we have the Nebraska Examiner, which is relatively new, that's a States Newsroom [outlet], and they are really open to collaborating.”
Notable: Students also must be involved up to six hours per week as part of the Experience Lab, but it’s up to the students how much they want to devote to statehouse coverage. The senior capstone class averages 25 to 40 students. The university foundation has a Nebraska News Service fund to which anyone can donate, and Nebraska alums donate. That fund helps pay for travel expenses when needed. Typically only student leads, who work 10 hours a week, are paid $11.25 per hour to manage, support, and edit fellow students.","Transcript Submitted, Waiting on Impact Survey",,"Public, Population size is above 20 thosands, Has any Journalism program",,,,,,,,"yes, there might be others here, ask Jill.",,,Not Found,University of Nebraska,Nebraska,-96.69693,40.818198,,,181464.0,,,,https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/Center-for-Community-News/pdfs/fact%20sheets/2/University_of_Nebraska.pdf,,,,,

Students are matched with a news outlet, preferably from their hometown, but in reality, the value added is being in Austin because of the shrinking capitol bureaus. The students worked with their newsroom editor under the guidance of former New York Times editor Kathleen McElroy and former Dallas Morning News Capitol bureau chief Christy Hoppe. 
Distribution: The three-hour undergraduate class is capped at 18 students for accreditation purposes and to ensure the students are matched with a professional news media outlet in the state. Most of the outlets are traditional print or online publications, ranging from large metro dailies to weeklies. Students, who get a modest stipend from their newsrooms and a Journalism endowment, are scheduled to produce at least five stories over the semester. 
Looking forward: The program is not looking to expand.
Notable: The Capitol building is a 30-minute walk or an 8-minute drive from campus (with free parking!).

Colorado College,Journalism Institute,The Journalism Institute is a freestanding program at Colorado College that prioritizes hands-on reporting experience and long-form journalism projects through partnerships with local news publications and other organizations.,News Academic Partnership: 2024 or Earlier,,,Corey Hutchins,Co-Director,https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/journalism-institute/,Colorado Springs,CO,chutchins@coloradocollege.edu,2018,2025 Faculty Champion,"Summary: The Journalism Institute (JI) is a freestanding program at Colorado College (CC) that prioritizes hands-on reporting experience and long-form journalism projects through partnerships with local news publications and other organizations. While journalism has a long history at Colorado College, JI was launched in 2018 as a “hub” for its journalism minor in partnership with various media organizations. It is run as an experiential program focused on local news. Each JI course is three and a half weeks long–per Colorado College’s unique and intensive “Block Plan” class structure–and is taught either by a CC professor or a visiting faculty member, often from a prominent news publication. Around 45 to 50 journalism minors have graduated from the JI since its founding.
Distribution: Student stories are published via rolling partnerships with professional news organizations, internships, the program’s practicum, and by pitching their stories to local outlets. In 2024, JI had about 50 students 2024, with 195 stories produced in 16 news outlets outside of campus publications, including in Colorado Public Radio, Denver Gazette, Rocky Mountain PBS, NPR, Denver Post, Axios Denver, and more.
Looking forward: JI will continue filling local news gaps and seeking more opportunities for community engagement through its various partnerships and student practicums. Most recently, the Institute identified a news desert in a rural Colorado county with no local newspaper and residents who relied on a Facebook page to get their local news. Students began filing open records requests with local governments, to publish directly onto that Facebook page as well as asking the community what they want to see now that their newspaper is gone. This is CC’s News Desert Project (informally).
Notable: The College does not have a journalism major. Its journalism minor allows for smaller classes and students from all different majors, making it more academically diverse. Students must take both an internship and a Capstone practicum to graduate with a minor in journalism, though sometimes these two can be combined if the student is producing news stories. JI promotes interdisciplinary partnerships, for example, offering a class on wildfire reporting that was funded by the National Science Foundation. Students are encouraged to pitch to various media outlets, and JI faculty members help students secure internships with local newspapers, radio stations, and other news outlets. 
The College itself provides minimal financial support, so JI operates primarily through grants and other fundraising/partnership opportunities outside CC.

Beth Potter, who has about 30 years of journalism experience including 10 years overseas, taught the three-credit elective course as an adjunct professor. The class met twice a week, and students traveled to the statehouse twice over the entire semester. Students traveled from campus to the statehouse via a 30-minute bus ride, which is free for students. They shared space on the press row with professionals. Colorado’s legislature only meets in the spring. During the following fall semester, Potter aimed to continue political and legislative coverage by holding the class and having students work together to report a ballot initiative for the 2024 election concerning hunting mountain lions. Not all students’ work produced during the two semesters in which the class operated was published by partners. During the spring semester, a few stories were published among the dozen or so students in the class. During the fall semester, one major story jointly reported by the class was distributed across the state. This year, she is pausing it indefinitely because she was promoted in her newsroom role outside of UC Boulder, along with other competing duties. Despite her pausing it, she said journalism students are still going to the Capitol voluntarily to pursue stories for student media, partly due to word of mouth on the success of the last two semesters.","Transcript Submitted, Waiting on Impact Survey","Paused, Statehouse, ""Democracy, Governance & Elections"", Part of a Class, Students Get Course Credit","Public, Has any Journalism program, Population size 10-20 thousands",,,,,,,,,,,,,Colorado,-105.270823,40.008781,,,,,,,,,,,,

The statehouse program is just one part of ASU’s Cronkite News class. Students take the class for credit. Students either pitch the story ideas or they are assigned story. Faculty members edit the work. Cronkite News also operates two websites that carry digital versions of its stories. One site is designated for the public to access those stories in readable format. The other is available only to partner news organizations across Arizona, which can pull content from that online menu to offer to their own readers, listeners and viewers. Partners subscribe to the daily Cronkite News digest and have unrestricted access to use Cronkite work however they choose, as long as they give the students credit. Cronkite News uses Slack with a pick-up channel that shows where its stories go. Any news organization can ask Cronkite News to join its listserv for access to the digest for free. 
Distribution: Students produce a Monday-through-Thursday newscast that airs on Arizona PBS, its main partner, and about 180 additional publication partners regularly publish their content. 
Looking forward: Faculty say they have a lot of competition in the Phoenix metro, so most of their distribution for statehouse stores, in particular, are picked up by outlets sites that are more out of the Phoenix metro area. Therefore, they are interested in growing their potential partners.

While in the statehouse, the students are considered to be full members of the professional press corps covering the Legislature. 
Distribution: The students produce written and broadcast reports of the daily events in the statehouse for more than 150 outlets across the state. 
Looking forward: As nonprofit news outlets are gaining footing at the statehouse, Cowgill is strategizing ways that students can approach non-duplicative news stories for the community; this has meant going after more niche stories, such as the sale of lab-grown meat.

During the week, students also get additional media training through the School’s news service, Idaho Public Radio. Students spend about every weekday and sometimes weekends, depending on whether there’s a news event, during January, February and March working at the statehouse during the session. Students tend to be juniors and 11 seniors. The program is open to any student; international studies majors participated in 2022 and 2023. The course is recognized as a 400-level internship and includes an average of 9 credits, though some students do less. 
Distribution: Students live in the Boise area that semester, oftentimes with their families, fulfilling a near-full course load by writing a weekly story for six or seven weekly rural newspapers around the state which are part of the program, which started circa 2015. Students write one story per week, and editors regularly reach out to students with story ideas. 
Looking forward: “If we're going to add, we would add more weeklies” because the larger newspapers are already sharing content with one another. “We would put our resources into giving a leg up to the other papers, to the rural weeklies. So that's been our philosophy, and certainly, we don't have them all.”
Notable: Sometimes political science faculty have offered students additional credit for additional work, e.g,. research papers on their experience, to fill other degree requirements outside the journalism program, too.

Liss said the program has a good success rate with placing students in newsrooms: “Anecdotally, I cannot think of a local newsroom where we don't have an alum working there, or doing a fellowship there, or interning there,” she said. 
Looking forward: Liss wants to expand the investigative arm of the University’s journalism program: Cal State offers another class that is still connected to UT Community News but with a focus on long-form watchdog reporting. Each semester, students partner with local news outlets, such as KnockLA and LA Public Press, to produce investigative series. “I think if we had…funding or other resources to expand that [UT Community News], that could create a really great local watchdog center,” Liss said.","Transcript Submitted, Waiting on Impact Survey",,"Public, Minority-Serving Institution, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands",,,,,,,Everything is done but no impact survey stats returned.

Just want to flag that Sarah Gamard,College of Humanities and Interdisciplinary Studies; Department of Mass Communication,Yolanda Campbell,"Interim Chair, Associate Professor",,Baton Rouge,LA,yolanda.campbell@sus.edu,,,"Summary: The Louisiana Collegiate News Collaborative appears to be the first of its kind in the U.S. Louisiana State University, which is leading the collaborative, is working with seven other higher education institutions in Louisiana to work with faculty and news outlets to produce student-reported community news across the state. Those schools are: Grambling University (HBCU), Dillard University (HBCU), Xavier University (HBCU), Southern University (HBCU), Nicholls State University, Northwestern State University and Southeastern University. The collaborative will be headed by two faculty at LSU: student media advisor Jeff Gauger and professional-in-residence Lisa Page, who graduated from Dillard University before working at the Times-Picayune and Washington Post. 
Distribution: As of mid-February, Gauger sends out a weekly email to the network of participating faculty and editors. He is also forming a website for the collaboration. Each school will have initially two to four students who will get paid $12 an hour for up to 10 hours of work a week during the fall and spring semesters. Additionally, each school will host one full-time summer internship where the student will be paid $12 an hour to write stories for their local community outlets. Reporting can include print, digital, broadcast and social media. To encourage more stories out of classrooms, students reporting for a class can earn a $100 stipend for any publishable story at any of these schools. Individual schools can decide whether students can also earn credit by participating this program.
Looking forward: Ideally, this collaboration will grow to include more schools in Louisiana and serve as an emulatable model for other states.
Notable: Funding comes from the MacArthur Foundation and the Henry Luce Foundation.

Have reached out multiple times for those stats.,Seaver College ,Elizabeth Smith,Associate Professor of Journalism,https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/communication/undergraduate/journalism/,Malibu,CA,elizabeth.smith@pepperdine.edu,1937,,"Summary: Pepperdine University is a private Christian research university affiliated with the Churches of Christ in Los Angeles County. Pepperdine Graphic Media (PGM) is the University’s student-led digital-first newsroom attached to the journalism program, which lives in the University’s Communication Division. PGM includes The Graphic, a student-run (now online) newspaper that has covered Malibu and surrounding communities since 1937, and Currents Magazine, produced once per semester. About 75 to 90 students participate in PGM yearly, on average. PGM is co-curricular, whereby it doesn’t operate as a class, but students can earn academic credit. Journalism majors and minors are required to participate in student reporting efforts. In addition to PGM, NewsWaves is the University’s student-led television news show.
Distribution: Student work is published through formal partnerships, live shots, and other occasional reporting opportunities. There isn’t a consistent newsroom partnership in place. PGM students partnered with Malibu Times to support a long-form state land project, and that series was published. Students have also covered breaking news for broadcast networks like CNN. And when breaking news hits, traffic on The Graphic’s website can increase by thousands of viewers, a testament to its reputation as a source of news in the community. “Students are definitely known in the community,” Smith said. “It’s not surprising when they show up to a council meeting.”
Looking forward: Pepperdine is opening its second undergraduate college in the fall of 2025: The College of Health Science. Currently, Seaver College is Pepperdine’s only undergraduate college. This could provide additional opportunities to partner with another major (Smith said the journalism program hasn’t yet done so officially).","Transcript Submitted, Waiting on Impact Survey",,"Private, Has any Journalism program, Faith-Based,  Population size 5-10 thousands",,,,,,,Everything is done but no impact survey stats returned.

These news sites have a total of five classes devoted to them, three for Oakland North and two for Richmond Confidential. About 60 graduate students write for these two sites in the fall via those classes. Come January, when those classes end, news reporting on those sites decreases. Spring semester offers a Local News Enterprise class, whereby about a dozen students work on longer form projects, about one story per month. These stories are not always publishable as they have to reach a certain bar. In the summer, the program has two paid interns, one per news site and who each publish stories at least twice weekly. 
Distribution: In addition to Berkeley’s two news sites, students also produce stories for local news organizations. The program works with two consistent daily news sites where student work gets published in: The Oaklandside and Richmondside, both community newsrooms launched by a Bay Area nonprofit called CitySide. The program is part of several external collaborative initiatives, including the California Local News Fellowship and the California Reporting Project, which tasked students to investigate police excessive force records and cases across the state in collaboration with local newsrooms. Major investigative projects like this are in outlets like the Dallas Morning News, LA Times, Grist, and the San Francisco Chronicle. The program also developed a project funded by the SCAN Foundation called “Aging in America.” Paid interns will report on aging issues, such as rural transportation. So far, 40 Aging in America stories have been published in the New York Times, local NPR stations, the Oregonian, and other outlets. While the grant funds only go so far (not every student gets to travel), they can fund student travel expenses. 
Looking forward: The program just launched a program called The Stakes, a UC Berkeley Journalism project looking at the Trump administration’s executive orders and its effect on California communities, including various cuts in federal funding and suspension of grants. Here’s an example.
Notable: What makes student publication at Berkeley unique is that students hold the copyrights to their stories, so Berkeley cannot offer them to other publications without the student’s permission.","Transcript Submitted, Waiting on Impact Survey",,"Public, Minority-Serving Institution, Has any Journalism program, Population size is above 20 thosands","Steve Katz (Asst.

Faculty member John Tomasic runs the program. Between three and five students produce at least 100 stories on the legislature per year – sometimes more – in the program. The University of Washington is housed in Seattle, about an hour and 15 minutes away from the capitol by car. Students in this program are housed together via a short-term rental near the capitol instead of commuting. The housing plan is paid for by a donation from alums, totaling about $5,000 a year, that the program gives as stipends to the students who use it to pay rent in Olympia during the ten-week winter quarter when the legislature every year is in session.

Students focus on reporting on the spring session of the Hawaii State Legislature in Honolulu. Each student selects a beat at the beginning of the semester and is responsible for coming up with story ideas connecting that beat with current legislative action. In the first year, the program had 12 students participate; in 2023, they had 15 students; in 2024, another 22 students were involved.
Distribution: Two course instructors edit the stories before forwarding them to editors at Civil Beat for publication on their website.
Looking forward: Oppegaard has built a generative AI tool that helps edit student work, and it’s (watch)dog-themed. It launched Spring of 2024. He said: “It's free to use [and] gives you 10 times your assessment power in terms of giving students feedback, and it's done immediately. Now you don't have to wait a week to get your feedback on your draft.”
Notable: The idea was born from the long-standing relationship between 10 the two organizations and was spearheaded by the Journalism program's Director, Brett Oppegaard, and a Civil Beat political reporter, Blaze Lovell. The program is funded through the University and is a three-credit course coordinated through a senior-level ""Innovation and Entrepreneurship"" class co-taught by Lovell and Oppegaard, which is the final required class in the program's curriculum.
